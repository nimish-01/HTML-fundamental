    <p>India’s retail inflation in May eased to a 25-month low of 4.25 per cent, data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday showed. Meanwhile, India’s Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in April rose sharply to 4.2 per cent from 1.1 per cent in March.

        The headline inflation or consumer price inflation (CPI) last month at 4.25 per cent remained below the upper threshold of the Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term 4+/- 2 percent target.
        
        The retail inflation remained within the tolerance range of the RBI for the third consecutive month. In April, India’s retail inflation eased to an 18-month low of 4.70 per cent, while in March, it stood at 5.66 per cent.

    <p>Development in the global south was impacted by “geopolitical tensions” and the COVID-19 pandemic, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. Inaugurating the G20 Development Ministers’ meeting in Varanasi, PM Modi called for “inclusive and fair” attempts to achieve global developmental goals and said India is following a “women-led” development model. Speaking on the occasion, External Affairs Minister highlighted the requirement to deal with supply chain disruptions and reminded the developed economies that “cherry-picking” is not an effective approach to deal with collective challenges. </p>
    <p>“Development is a core isssue for the Global South. The countries of Global South were severely impacted by the disruptions created by the Global Covid pandemic. And, the food, fuel and fertiliser crises because of geo-political tensions have delivered another blow. We must ensure that no one is left behind,” said Prime Minister Modi in a video message that was played at the beginning of the event. India, the current Chair of the G20 is hosting the G20 Development Ministers’ Meeting in Varanasi with a focus on supply chain disruptions, food and energy security challenges, climate change and post-pandemic recovery. In his speech, PM Modi did not make a clear mention of the Ukraine crisis that has featured prominently in all the G20-related events that India has hosted so far. </p>

    <p>In his remarks PM Modi urged the G20 to overcome challenges posed by “data divide” and said “high quality” data is critical for development goals and said, “Technology is being used as a tool to empower people, make data accessible, and ensure inclusivity. India is willing to share its experience with partner countries.” PM Modi further said that women are setting the developmental targets and urged for the G20 to adopt the Action Plan for Women-led Development. </p>
    <p>Mr. Jaishankar described the SDGs as “landmark” but pointed out that the international community has not pursued them in a well-coordinated manner saying, “Unfortunately, since its adoption in 2015, not only have we seen the political momentum wither, but we have also witnessed fragmentation in international priorities wherein some goals are deemed more important than others. Such cherry picking is not in our collective interest.” </p>
    <p>Mr. Jaishankar who in his capacity as the External Affairs Minister of India is also the face of India’s projects concerning international development cooperation laid down the line of argument that India is expected to take on development issues during the relevant upcoming summits beginning with the G20 summit that will take place in Delhi in September. The New Delhi G20 summit will be followed by the SDG Summit during September 18-19 in New York, the COP28 Summit in Dubai in November-December, and the Summit of the Future that will also take place in September on the sideline of the U.N. General Assembly’s annual session in 2024. “Our efforts will strengthen the hands of our Leaders when they come together at these historic summits, that I have spoken about, which are still ahead of us,” said Mr. Jaishankar.</p>
